**ABOUT THE PROJECT**

This project took me on an explorative dive into:

- the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM),
- what are event listeners, their uses, how they work, and the different types of events one can listen for.
- the differences between a nodeList and an array; what methods do they have and **not** have in common.

I had fun creating this project. I got a little more exposed to the Developers' tool as well as working in the Javascript Console. I hope to create more challenging projects soon and grow my skill brilliantly.
